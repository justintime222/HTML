<h1>Our View</h1>
	<p>We acknowledge that there may be some damage done to the film industry by 
	piracy, but we believe that it is nowhere near as bad as it is made to seem, 
	our contention is that if the movie industry puts out a figure comparing how 
	much they make compared to how much is lost we may believe them. For all we 
	know, the few billions of dollars they say are done in damages, do they make 
	in hundreds of billions? If so then how exactly does a few percent of their 
	income pose such a threat?</p>
